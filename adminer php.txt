To install Adminer (phpMinAdmin) on Ubuntu 18.04, you can follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
1. Ensure that you have PHP installed. We can install it with the following command if not already installed:

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install php


2. Need a web server. Use Apache or Nginx. Here, I'll provide instructions for Apache.

1. Download Adminer:
   Adminer is a single PHP file, so we can just download it to your server. We can download the latest version from the official website 	https://www.adminer.org/#download.


   wget https://www.adminer.org/latest.php -O /var/www/html/adminer.php


   This command will download Adminer and save it as `adminer.php` in the `/var/www/html` directory. We can choose a different directory if we prefer.

2. Configure Web Server:

   If We're using Apache, We might need to enable the `rewrite` module and restart Apache:

   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   sudo systemctl restart apache2


3. Access Adminer:

   Once you've done this, We can access Adminer by visiting `http://your_server_ip/adminer.php` on web browser.

4. Secure Adminer (Optional):

   It's recommended to secure Adminer with a login mechanism, especially if it's exposed to the internet. We can set up basic authentication using Apache's `.htaccess` file.

   Create an `.htaccess` file in the same directory as `adminer.php`:

	sudo nano /var/www/html/.htaccess

   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Restricted Access"
   AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
   Require valid-user


   Create the `.htpasswd` file to store usernames and passwords:

   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user_name


   This will prompt us to set a password for the user `adminer_user`. 

   After setting up the `.htaccess` file, make sure to restart Apache:

   sudo systemctl restart apache2

sudo apt install php-mysql
sudo systemctl restart apache2
